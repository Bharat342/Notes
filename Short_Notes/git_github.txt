 
 Git Branches : Git branches are used to maintain seperate code bases for multiple teams working in the same project.
 -> Using git branched multiple teams can work paralelly.
 -> In project, one team work shouldn't effect other teams work. We can resolve this issue using git branches concept.

 Note : We can use any name for the branch and we can create any number of branches in git repo.

 -> git init
 -> git status
 -> git add
 -> git add .
 -> git commit -m "message"
 -> git log
 -> git log --oneline
 -> git remote add origin <Repo url>
 -> git remote -v
 -> git branch -m main master, git branch -m master main 
 -> git push -u origin main
 -> git push -u origin main --force
 -> git push
 -> git pull
 -> git pull origin main
 -> git clone -b <branch name> <Repo url>
 -> 



 -> Branch merging using pull request.

 -> There are 2 scenarios when we will get the comflicts in the git repository
    1. When we go for git pull if Repository changes and our local changes is are in the same file same line then we will get the conflict.
    2. When we are merging the changes from one branch to another branch then also there is a chance of getting the conflict. (it is only called merge conflict).
 

 git stash command ?
 -> it is used to store working tree changes to the temp area and make working tree clean.

 -> In order to do this we execute a command "git stash" 
 -> git stash 
 -> git stash apply

 === git fetch vs git pull ===
 $ git pull : download latest code changes from central/remote repository and merge with the working tree directly. There is a chance of getting conflicts.

 $ git fetch : download latest code changes from central repo to local repo. It will not merge changes into working tree.
 
 Note : After git fetch completed, we need to execute 'git merge' command to merge changes from local repo to working tree.

 git pull = git fetch + fit merge

 -> git revert : It is used to remove the changes we have commited from remote repository based on the commit id.
    
	$ git revert <commit-id>
